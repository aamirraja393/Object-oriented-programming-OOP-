# 🦛 Hippo Quest: A Text-Based Adventure Game 🏰  

**Hippo Quest**, the text-based adventure game I built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** 🎮  

In this game, you're able to adventure through challenges and puzzles, mysterious rooms, collect items, and battle monsters. 
  
### 🗝️ Game Overview  
- The game starts at the **burning drawbridge** 🌉🔥, where the first mission is to find a bucket of water to put out the fire.  
- Each room is created with the idea of presenting a new challenge, which comes from finding some form of 🗝️, but the puzzles I designed can change in complexity we venture further.  
- The adventurer is equipped with a **backpack** 🎒 to store items—but I created it with limited space to add more difficulty.  

### 🏠 Rooms within the game:  
- 🌉 **Drawbridge**  
- 🐴 **Great Stables**  
- ⚔️ **Armory**  
- 🏰 **Burning Castle**  
- 🐉 **Dragon's Lair**  
- 🍳 **Kitchen**  
- 🥖 **Pantry**  
- …and more  

Each room is designed with creative puzzles, monsters, and twists to keep the adventure creative.  

### 🛠️ How It Was Built  
**Hippo Quest** combines the multiple Python files attached with a focus on **OOP principles** 🐍:  
- 🧩 **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes and objects were used to structure the game efficiently, making it modular and reusable.  
- ✅ **Unit testing** to ensure smooth gameplay with no errors.  

### 📂 Supporting Files  
- 🖥️ **Python Code**: Several Python files work together to create the game. Deploy them in Anaconda to the game.  
- 📄 **UML Diagram**: The uml.pdf file is included to explain how OOP powers the game.  
- 🗺️ **Game Map**: The Hippo Quest.pdf file outlines how the game works and provides a visual map of the maze, alongside providing a more detailed explanation of how the game was created.  

I hope you enjoy it! 🚀🗡️
